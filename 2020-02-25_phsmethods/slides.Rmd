```{r setup, include = FALSE}
# Load packages required
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
library(phsmethods)
library(gt)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

pub_text <- c("Table 1 (Hospital Standardised Mortality Ratios)",
              paste("Table 2 (NHSScotland, NHS Board and hospital overall", 
                    "crude mortality trends and NHSScotland crude mortality", 
                    "trends by demographics and quarter)"),
              paste("Table 3 (Crude 30-day mortality from discharge and", 
                    "Overall population crude mortality rates by NHS Board", 
                    "and quarter)"))
```

## Why write [{phsmethods}](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/phsmethods)?

- Benefit to PHS: lots of analysts do the same things in different ways - it's a waste of time and effort and causes inconsistencies

- Benefit to developers and contributors: to learn how to write a 'real' package

## file_size()
```{r}
# All files in the data folder
file_size(here::here("2020-02-25_phsmethods", "data"))
```

## file_size()
```{r}
# Excel files only
file_size(here::here("2020-02-25_phsmethods", "data"), 
          pattern = "\\.xlsx$")
```

## file_size() in practice
This is the 'List of Tables' section from page 25 of the [2019-11-12 HSMR publication](https://www.isdscotland.org/Health-Topics/Quality-Indicators/Publications/2019-11-12/2019-11-12-HSMR-Report.pdf):

```{r, echo = FALSE, size = "150%"}
include_graphics(here::here("2020-02-25_phsmethods", "images", "2019-11-12_HSMR-Tables.jpg"))
```

## Recreate using file_size and [{gt}](https://gt.rstudio.com/)
```{r, gt, results = "hide", warning = FALSE}
file_size(here::here("2020-02-25_phsmethods", "data"), 
          pattern = "\\.xlsx$") %>%
  mutate(name = pub_text) %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_style(style = cell_borders(),
            locations = cells_body()) %>%
  tab_style(style = cell_text(color = "white", weight = "bolder"),
            locations = cells_column_labels()) %>%
  tab_style(style = cell_text(color = "purple", 
                              decorate = "underline"),
            locations = cells_body(columns = vars(name))) %>%
  tab_style(style = cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            locations = cells_body(columns = vars(name, size))) %>%
  tab_style(style = cell_fill(color = "darkorchid4"),
            locations = cells_column_labels()) %>%
  cols_width(vars(name) ~ px(620), TRUE ~ px(75)) %>%
  cols_label(name = "File Name", size = "File and Size")
```

## Recreate using file_size and [{gt}](https://gt.rstudio.com/)

```{r, ref.label = "gt", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
```

## fin_year() and qtr() functions

```{r, warning = FALSE}
lubridate::dmy(25022020)

fin_year(lubridate::dmy(25022020))
qtr(lubridate::dmy(25022020))
qtr(lubridate::dmy(25022020), format = "short")
```

## fin_year() and qtr() in RMarkdown

This is from the 'Main Points' section of the [2019-11-26 Smoking Cessation Services summary report](https://www.isdscotland.org/Health-Topics/Public-Health/Publications/2019-11-26/2019-11-26-SmokingCessationLDPstandard-Summary.pdf?):

```{r, echo = FALSE, size = "200%"}
include_graphics(here::here("2020-02-25_phsmethods", "images", "2019-11-26_Smoking-Cessation-Services.jpg"))
```

## fin_year() and qtr() in RMarkdown

In RMarkdown:

```{r}
data_end <- lubridate::dmy(30062019)
```

During Quarter **`r lubridate::quarter(data_end, fiscal_start = 4)`** **`r paste0("(", qtr(data_end), ")")`**  
`r "\U2022"` In the **`r english::ordinal(lubridate::quarter(data_end, fiscal_start = 4))`** quarter of financial year **`r fin_year(data_end)`**, NHS Scotland contributed 23.1% (1,624 out of 7,026 self-reported twelve-week quits) towards the required annual LDP Standard. If this pattern continued for the remainder of the financial year, NHS Scotland would achieve 92.4% of the required Standard.

## fin_year() and qtr() in RMarkdown

In RMarkdown:

```{r}
data_end <- lubridate::dmy(30062019)
```

During Quarter `lubridate::quarter(data_end, fiscal_start = 4)` `paste0("(", qtr(data_end), ")")`  
`"\U2022"` In the `english::ordinal(lubridate::quarter(data_end, fiscal_start = 4))` quarter of financial year `fin_year(data_end)`, NHS Scotland contributed 23.1% (1,624 out of 7,026 self-reported twelve-week quits) towards the required annual LDP Standard. If this pattern continued for the remainder of the financial year, NHS Scotland would achieve 92.4% of the required Standard.

## Other functions in phsmethods

- `postcode()` formats improperly recorded postcodes
- `qtr_end()` calculates the final month in a quarter
- `qtr_next()` calculates the next quarter
- `qtr_prev()` calculates the previous quarter

## Future developments

- Contributions from others in PHS - development is under way to develop functions to group ages into age bands and to turn geography codes into names

- Build a [{pkgdown}](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) website?

- Create functions for agreed-upon methodologies by the 'new SAG'
