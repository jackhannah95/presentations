## tidylog

- [tidylog](https://github.com/elbersb/tidylog) provides wrappers around basic 
[dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) functions

- These wrapper functions print a message in the console to describe the result 
of applying the corresponding dplyr function

- To use, just load tidylog after dplyr:

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidylog)
```


## tidylog::filter()

```{r}
df <- tibble::tibble(chi_number = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
                     main_condition = c("J430", "R268", "J404", 
                                        "J449"))
df
```


## tidylog::filter()

```{r}
df <- tibble::tibble(chi_number = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
                     main_condition = c("J430", "R268", "J404", 
                                        "J449"))

# Select cases with COPD diagnosis (J40 - J44)
copd <- df %>%
  tidylog::filter(grepl("^j4[0-4]", main_condition))

# No rows selected - check code for error
```


## tidylog::filter()

```{r}
df <- tibble::tibble(chi_number = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
                     main_condition = c("J430", "R268", "J404", 
                                        "J449"))

# Select cases with COPD diagnosis (J40 - J44)
copd <- df %>%
  tidylog::filter(grepl("^J4[0-4]", main_condition))
```


## here

- If you ever start an R script with setwd() or rm(list = ls()) - stop

- Instead, use [here](https://here.r-lib.org/) and [RStudio Projects](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects)

- Projects automatically set your working directory and here allows you to 
define filepaths relatively to it

```{r}
library(here)
```


## here::here()

```{r message = FALSE}
# Save earlier dataset as CSV file to `data` sub-folder
readr::write_csv(df, here::here("2019-03-26_obscure-packages", 
                                "data", 
                                "df.csv"))

# Now load it back in
readr::read_csv(here::here("2019-03-26_obscure-packages", 
                           "data", 
                           "df.csv"))
```


## janitor

- [janitor](https://sfirke.github.io/janitor/) provides a multitude of functions 
for 'cleaning' data

- It's specifically designed with beginner and intermediate R users in mind

- While not part of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/), it's 
designed to work well with pipes

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "30%"}
include_graphics(here::here("2019-03-26_obscure-packages", "images", "janitor_logo.png"))
```


## janitor::clean_names()

```{r}
names <- tibble::tibble(VAR_ONE = "ALL CAPS",
                        var.two = "dot",
                        VarThree = "No space",
                        `Var four` = "Space",
                        `% Var` = "symbol")
names
```


## janitor::clean_names()

```{r}
names <- tibble::tibble(VAR_ONE = "ALL CAPS",
                        var.two = "dot",
                        VarThree = "No space",
                        `Var four` = "Space",
                        `% Var` = "symbol")
names %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```


## fuzzyjoin

- You're probably familiar with dplyr's join operators (`left_join`, `full_join`, 
`anti_join`, etc.)

- [fuzzyjoin](https://github.com/dgrtwo/fuzzyjoin) provides similar operators - 
the difference being they allow inexact matching

- For example, `dplyr::left_join(x, y, by = "p")` adds variables from y to x for 
observations which have the same value of p in both datasets

- `fuzzyjoin::fuzzy_left_join(x, y, by = "p", match.fun = `` `>` ``)` adds  
variables from y to x for observations which have a greater value of p in x than 
in y


## fuzzyjoin::fuzzy_left_join()

```{r}
# Use same dataset as before
df <- tibble::tibble(chi_number = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
                     main_condition = c("J430", "R268", "J404", 
                                        "J449"))
# Define lookup file
look <- tibble::tibble(code = c("J40", "J410", "J42", "J43", "J449"),
                       value = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
look
```


## fuzzyjoin::fuzzy_left_join()

- Suppose you want to add the 'value' variable from the lookup to the data for 
cases when the lookup code matches a substring of a patient's ICD10 code

- Using `dplyr::left_join()` would likely necessitate an arduous process of 
creating new substring variables in each dataset, doing two joins, then 
combining variables


## fuzzyjoin::fuzzy_left_join()

Using `fuzzyjoin::fuzzy_left_join()` and `stringr::str_detect()`:

```{r}
df %>%
  fuzzyjoin::fuzzy_left_join(look, 
                             by = c("main_condition" = "code"),
                             match_fun = stringr::str_detect)
```
